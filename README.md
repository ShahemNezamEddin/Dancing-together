# Dancing Together

The dancing together website is for parents and children looking for fun dancing classes for kids.
our school offers fun activities for kids to learn how to dance from a young age because dancing is simply the best way to exercise, relax and have fun!

The users of this site can see information about our school, teachers, dance types, class days, and times.

They can register for it, and ask questions or give feedback.

This website allows the school to make easier connections with parents and the kids and lets the school estimate how many students will attend each class.
