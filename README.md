## Design choices

  ### Typography
  - The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively.
  - 'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the cursive whilst being easy to read for all. 
  - 'Oswald' is used based on google font paring with 'Lato'.
  - Dancing together site is using both fonts same as Love Running Project.

  ### Color scheme
  - The color scheme chosen is based on using our main image in [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/).
  - Choose the main color #F2E4D8 and use it in [My color space](https://mycolor.space/) to choose color group for our site.
  - Use the color group to get the [contrast-grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/).
